# UFO Sightings with Javascript

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
In this project, we will use JavaScript by looking into its technical aspects and how it applies to the field of data analytics and visualization. To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time rather than the date, this challange provides more table filters such as the city, state, country, and shape.

***JavaScript introduction: Javascript is not related to Java. It is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.

In this challange, we'll need to apply your HTML and Bootstrap skills and have an open mind regarding semicolons.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

- The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage
 - This webpage is based on a local path link rather than a true website. Thus, we are not able to share it with people. 

- The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development
